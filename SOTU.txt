It's not particularly great yet. It's not much, but There are a lot of scrap-files. research hours, and edits/learning experiences going 
into it. Those things will also make future development faster. We were researching, testing, and working with a bunch of different methods
and approaches as well as in the process of getting more image data to work with (our dataset is very small at the moment) when COVID came
around and started messing things up. I have a few notes of things I'd like to do after getting more data, including looking
into other pre-trained models to work with besides resnet50, looking into buiding a model from scratch once we have enough data to
have better results, looking at different ways to train the model on top of a pre-trained one, different methods of expanding the data
we do have with pre-processing, playing around with other optimizers and activation functions, etc. Lot's to do, but takes a while to
test things. So I'll probably look seriously into having a program just run a ton of variations automatically at this point as well.
A member of our team was focused on data collection and another one was looking into using a different backend. I'll probably start looking
into collecting data myself and then reach out to the other guy to see how far the other backend got to compare results.
